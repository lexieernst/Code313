                    <p>A new project to support minority entrepreneurs by highlighting their work and connecting them with the resources they need to grow their companies has launched in the Motor City.</p>

                    <p>
                    Detroit in Tech, a collaboration between Grand Circus, Google for Entrepreneurs, and Code2040, seeks to even the playing field in a growing ecosystem. According to Detroit in Tech’s website, 88 percent of the city’s population is Black and Latinx; why then, the organization is asking, does the city’s tech revival look so white?</p>

                    <p>Part of Detroit in Tech’s mission is to “normalize the idea of [people of color] being active participants in the industry.” Tara Reed, founder of Kollecto and entrepreneur in residence at Grand Circus, will lead the project for a year and then hand over the reins to her EIR successor. “The goal is to increase diversity in tech through monthly events highlighting ways people can get involved,” she explained. A kickoff fireside chat on Thursday covered what it’s like to learn to code as a person of color in Detroit, she said. Upcoming events will explore curricula for students, marketing, and other tech-themed offerings. The project’s website will also highlight the stories of local people working in the tech industry.</p>

                    <p>“It’s important to me because, as a country, we’ve seen tech drive a lot of economic change,” Reed said. “Right now, there’s a huge opportunity to grow the tech ecosystem as a large part of Detroit’s economy.” Detroit, she pointed out, has experienced technology-driven growth before, most notably during the first half of the 20th century in parallel with the rise of the automobile industry. However, the current political climate is such that Americans seem open to considering race-based economic and social injustice and how that injustice affects a city’s long-term prospects. If Detroit is truly in the midst of a tech-inspired growth spurt, as Reed and others believe, those opportunities need to find their way to all of the city’s residents, she said.</p>

                    <p>“I felt that I had a social responsibility, as a black woman, to launch my company in Detroit,” she said. “I love the spirit people have here.”</p>
