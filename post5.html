                    <p>The importance and quality of computer science education is becoming a national hot-button issue. In a state where the demand for software developers of applications is consistently a top in-demand job (including in fields like manufacturing), Michigan legislators are recognizing the need to make a change in education to ensure the state has enough worker supply to meet the growing demand. According to code.org, nine out of 10 parents want their children to learn computer science, but only one in four schools teach computer science.</p>

                    <p>
                    Michigan is working to pass legislation that will allow students to replace foreign language classes by learning computer programming, or coding languages, instead. Michigan has taken a few other important steps toward increasing the number of students that are interested and skilled in computer sciences, including allowing computer science to count toward core education requirements (one of 29 states to do so), as well as allowing it to count as an admission requirement for postsecondary education institutions. This newer piece of legislation is seen by supporters as a way to increase the number of computer science courses offered and taken advantage of by students in hopes they will follow this profitable and necessary career path.</p>

                    <p>While this legislation is a step in the right direction for Michigan, there are some misconceptions surrounding the purpose of the substitution. Some believe the ability to substitute credit for coding over foreign language means the supporting educators and legislators believe learning to code produces the same educational results as learning a foreign language. This is not the case. For example, in a foreign language course, students learn not just the language but also the culture and history of the geographic areas they are studying, while learning to program and code emphasizes logic skills and shares more similarities with math and science courses.</p>

                    <p>Supporters generally do not believe that learning to code is the same thing as learning a foreign language. The reason for supporting the proposed legislation is that it would allow students to choose their electives more effectively, and students interested in taking a foreign language and computer science courses could still do so.</p>

                     <p>Many other strategies exist to continue supporting computer science learning for Michigan students. The state does not yet require that all high schools offer computer science, does not require computer science for graduation, and does not provide dedicated funding for professional development for educators in computer science. While these options may be on the horizon, they each come with challenges. For example, requiring all secondary schools to offer computer science raises the question as to whether all secondary schools have the funds to support the technology required to teach computer science or qualified teachers to teach the subject.</p>

                     <p>There is much work to do around improving access to and quality in computer science education, but Michigan is on the forefront of making legislative changes to support these efforts. Though all may not agree that computer science should replace foreign language credits, giving Michigan students the choice may give them career options they may not otherwise have had.</p>
